# Python-Calculator-GUI
A calculator with an interface made with python tkinter

I made this calculator to have fun, train my python abilites and learn to use python tkinter library.
To use that, you just execute de .exe file, but if fails, you can execute the code that is at the .py file if you have already downloaded python
It's one of my first projects, so if you can, please rate it!
